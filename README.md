Two Chakma Handwriting Fonts have been created, enabling writing in the Chakma language in a handwriting style. 
Just as handwriting-style fonts are available for many other languages, these two fonts are the very first of their kind for Chakma and were released in 2024.
To strengthen and further develop the Chakma language, and to make its use as free and widespread as in other world languages, these fonts were greatly needed.

These fonts were designed by Bivuti Chakma. 
He is also the creator of several other Chakma fonts, including Chakma Unicode (Worldwide), NonoBivuKhamaC (used by NCTB in Bangladesh), and many more.

By digitally spreading the Chakma language across the world, he has made an invaluable contribution to the Chakma communityâ€”something no one else has achieved single-handedly until now. 
His contribution is surely a milestone in the advancement of the Chakma language.
